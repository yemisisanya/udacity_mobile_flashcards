## How it works
This is flashcard app that allows a user enter decks of cards as Topics, Movie Genres, books, etc. Each deck of card can hold as many questions as possible and a quiz can be performed on each deck. At the end of the quiz, user will see the results on how well they did on each quiz. The user has the option to retake the quiz or navigate to the decklist to start another quiz. Users will be notified when they havent taken a quiz for the day, only if the allow for notifications on the app.
